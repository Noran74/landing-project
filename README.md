## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.



My name is Noran Thabet and I am working on landing page project.
I've make some modification in HTML and CSS files,
First in HTML file, I added the "app.jss" to start working on it ,then I added new section called "section 4" ,because the least number of project is "4" .
Secand in CSS file , I made some changes in color and font size , also changed the hover color and the cursor shape..,then I used media query property to make the "landing page project" suitable and responsive to all devices .


Finally I used app.js file to do some dynamic properties.
1) I have created new elements in navigation bar " #navbar__list"

2) I have made the Scrolling behavior is so smooth and go directly to the defined section after clicking on it.

3)I have added active class  the defined section when we are scrolling to it.
4)Last not least I've changed some property in css file sheet .
